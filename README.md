## Topic
Investigating and Modeling of the Correlation of COVID
Cases and Regional Features based on Local Government Area in Victoria

## Research Purpose
The outbreak of Coronavirus not only continues to deteriorate the public health of Victorian residents, but also puts a heavy financial burden on the Victorian government due to the measures in response to the pandemic. For a long period of time, the Victorian government handled their response in a context of uncertainty. It’s important to understand why different suburbs have been hit differently in the pandemic by evaluating the correlation between severity of COVID cases and the asymmetric regional features in the aspects of health and social factors. As a research group, we aim to help the Victorian government to make differentiated territorial policies that most accurately tackle the issues of each specific Local Government Areas (LGA) that share common properties.
